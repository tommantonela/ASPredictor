# ASPredictor
This prototype tool supports the prediction of dependency-based Architectural Smells and also the evaluation of those predictions using a sequence of system versions. ASPredictor is designed as a pipeline of processing components. Each component receives a number of inputs and generates outputs for other components downstream. 

The components also allow several configuration options. The main functionality consists of three steps, namely: pre-processing, classification construction, and smell prediction.
