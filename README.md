# ASPredictor

This prototype tool supports the prediction of dependency-based Architectural Smells and also the evaluation of those predictions using a sequence of system versions. **ASPredictor** is designed as a pipeline of processing components. Each component receives a number of inputs and generates outputs for other components downstream.
